# Summary

This set of docker configurations enables someone to host halo2vista dedicated (h2server) in docker via wine.
 - h2server.exe is typically run on windows as a service
 - We have found through testing that h2server.exe can run on wine just fine with no performance drops

## Prerequisites 

- Familarity using docker and docker-compose
- Ability to open ports
- Ability to linux based distributions
- Ability to use git

## Setup

1. Clone the git repo
1. Edit the .env file (all the h2server properties live in this file)
1. You have two options at this point: manually configure docker-compose.yml or use build.sh (which builds the yml from the .env file)
